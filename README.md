This simple program helps you clean up environment variables (such as Path) and extend their maximum lengths.

Functions:
* Extend maximum length by creating and referencing new variables (Note that cmd.exe still truncates environment variables at 2047 characters after expanding)
* Remove duplicate paths
* Migrate user variables to system variables
* Convert semi-colon to line-break for easy editing and convert back
* Backup before saving
